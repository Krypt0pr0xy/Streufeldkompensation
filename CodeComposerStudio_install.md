# Important Installation Information
The complete installation guide is available at the following [link][1]. In this section I will only go into the most important points which are essential for this project.

First you need to download the files https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_downloads.html#code-composer-studio-version-10-downloads
I have tested it with the version 10. 
+ First they are asked about the Licende Agreement
+ If the system check was successful, you can proceed with the installation.
+ After that you will be asked for the installation path I recommend to use the predefined "C:\ti\ccs".
+ In the Setup Type menu it becomes very important:

## Choose Costum Installation 
In the new Window: ![Image][3] \
Choose `MSP430 ultra low power MCUs`

## This was the most important thing, the rest should be done in the standard install setup.
